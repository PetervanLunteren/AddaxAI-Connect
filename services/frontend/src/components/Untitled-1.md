- if we go to the next page, it takes a while to load the thumbnails in the background (main page). That shouldnt matter much if we're staying in the modal view, right? Is there an easy way of not haing to load everything once gogin to a new page? The modal should cache the current and next image right? Does that not work if the next image is on the next page? 

-  make sure the verified counts are taken for the dashboard visualisations, maps, etc. Please do a check where in the app currently it shows the AI annotations, where we want the human verified anotations to have preference. Make a list, and also make a plan on how to do this in terms of database structure. In simple words, the human verified annotations do always have more value than the AI predictions. But if there are no human verifications, we'll use the ai predictions. Does that make sense?
