# TODO list
- [ ] Make a page for project admins where we can include/exclude images from the view and statistics. That way we can exclude test images for example.
- [ ] Can we expand the rejected page for server admins to also see the contents of the uploads folder directly?
- [ ] blur people and vehicles disable only by server admin
- [ ] Limit the notifcation species options to only the ones selected to be poresent in the project.
- [ ] The filtering options in the IMages page do not take into account the detection threhsold. If there eg is a fox below the det thresh, and a dog above it, the image will still show up if you search for "fox". 
- [ ] Make it so that the webapp looks like a native app on iphone. 

**SPW points**
- [ ] export to camtrap DP
- [ ] Edit labels in ImageDetailModal. No need to adjust bounding boxes, just the counts per species. 
- [ ] Add a project artifacts upload and download function. Good for storing settings files, etc. 
- [ ] NEW server spw.addaxai.com project namne: ANLIER NORD
- [ ] email notifications daily report
- [ ] map for camera's to see where the batterys are low, etc.
