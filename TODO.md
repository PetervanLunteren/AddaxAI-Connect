# TODO list
- [ ] The email verification feature works perfectly, but it seems like we do not really use it, since users can only register on a invitation basis anyway. Is that true? If so, we might want to avoid the registration link sending, since that is confusing to users. It would be a waste to just delete that perfectly working code, but we might want to avoid using it for now...
- [ ] If a user that is not on the invitation list / white list tries to register, nothing happens. There should be an error message or something like that.
- [ ] Make a page for project admins where we can include/exclude images from the view and statistics. That way we can exclude test images for example.
- [ ] Can we expand the rejected page for server admins to also see the contents of the uploads folder directly?
- [ ] Add a detection threshold setting. 
- [ ] Test the new Pure-FTPd daemon with real camera images.
- [ ] Put the logout feature of the server page in the hamburger menu, and make the list items role based, not the hamburger menu itself. Also put the email address inside the hamburger menu.
