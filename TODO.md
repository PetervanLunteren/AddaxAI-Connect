# TODO list

# Add camera profile
INSTAR — implemented as a path-based profile.

- Custom-path format: `INSTAR/lat<LAT>_lon<LON>` (e.g. `INSTAR/lat52.02368_lon12.98290`).
- Camera registered in Camera Management with `device_id = lat52.02368_lon12.98290`.
- Path-based profile parses lat/lon from the path segment and datetime from the filename.
- `record/*.mp4` clips are logged and deleted (no video support).
- `Test-Snapshot.jpeg` is rejected as `missing_datetime`.
- See `docs/camera-requirements.md` for the full setup guide.

Open follow-ups:
- Confirm what the `A_` filename prefix means once more INSTAR firmwares are seen. If it turns out to be a per-unit channel ID, the device_id scheme needs to grow another segment.
- INSTAR sends no daily health reports, so the camera health page will stay empty for these cameras. Worth a UI hint someday.




# TODO: revert TEMP verbose logging once cold-tier + backup verification is done.
#       - services/minio-tier-watchdog/watchdog.py: re-enable the boto3/botocore/urllib3 silencer
#         (the commented-out `for noisy in (...): logging.getLogger(noisy).setLevel(logging.WARNING)` block).
#       - scripts/backup.sh: re-add `> /dev/null` to every mc call in the bucket setup block
#         and to the two `mc mirror` loops (marked with `# TEMP:`).
#       Grep `# TEMP:` across the repo to find all of them.

# TODO: revert TEMP success-email branch in services/notifications/infra_alert.py.
#       Once cold-tier + backup have run clean for a week, drop the two TEMP blocks
#       marked `# TEMP: also email admin_email on status=ok`. After removal the
#       infra_alert job only emails server admins on failure, which is the
#       permanent behavior. Grep `# TEMP:` to find.



# prio 1
- [ ] "Leave empty to get alerts for all species." this is not handy. What If i want to disable the telegram for a short time? Wouldnt it just be simplest to send requests for all the one selected? If none selected, you dont get any telegram notifications. Simple mental model. 
- [ ] The Excessive image alert email has a button "Inspect triggers". That brings you to the images page with with filters on that specific camera (good!), but also filters on "Empty" only. Why not show all images of that camera? That means tick all of the boxes in the "Labels" filter. That gives empties + all other labels. 
- [ ] The detection trend currently doesnt show the 0 days/weeks/months. It should. Check how its done here: /Users/peter/Documents/Repos/AddaxAI-WebUI/.

## TODO Priority 2
- [ ] 

## Possible future features
- [ ] Allow manual upload of all SD card images that were not transmitted, in order to benefit from automatic recognition and centralize all data on the server?
- [ ] multi language
- [ ] can we make it feel native on iphone and android without having it like a normal app? You can continue an previous claude session with > claude --resume c24bfc22-4e66-4bdd-abc6-d41f92b5c0c7
